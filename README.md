# Secure_Cloud_Infrastructure_With_Threat_Detection_And_Remediation
As a Cybersecurity Student, this project is about designing, implementing, and securing an AWS Environment

Steps I will take here are:

Identity and Access Management (IAM) – Setting up least privilege policies, MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication), and securing root account access.

Network Security – Designing a secure VPC with public and private subnets, configuring security groups, and using Network ACLs.

Encryption – Using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt sensitive data.

Real-Time Threat Detection – Using AWS services like GuardDuty for continuous monitoring and AWS Security Hub for centralized compliance checks.

Automation of Incident Response – Setting up AWS Lambda functions for automated response to threats (e.g., automatically isolating compromised instances).

Monitoring and Logging – Using CloudWatch and CloudTrail for monitoring, alerting, and auditing activity.
